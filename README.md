# NETFLIX-USERBASE-
NETFLIX VISUALIZATION USING POWER BI
I've been diving into the world of Netflix data using a fascinating dataset from Kaggle and I'm thrilled to share my latest project and some of my findings with you all. I built these visualizations using Power BI .

About Dataset
The dataset provides a snapshot of a sample Netflix userbase, showcasing various aspects of user subscriptions, revenue, account details, and activity. Each row represents a unique user, identified by their User ID. The dataset includes information such as the user's subscription type (Basic, Standard, or Premium), the monthly revenue generated from their subscription, the date they joined Netflix (Join Date), the date of their last payment (Last Payment Date), and the country in which they are located.
The dataset serves as a synthetic representation and does not reflect actual Netflix user data. It can be used for analysis and modeling to understand user trends, preferences, and revenue generation within a hypothetical Netflix userbase.
